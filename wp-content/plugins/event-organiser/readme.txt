Create and maintain events, including complex reoccurring patterns, venue management (with Google maps), calendars and customisable event lists

== Description ==

Event Organiser adds event management that integrates well with your WordPress site. By using WordPress' in-built 'custom post type', this plug-in allows you to create events that have the same functionality as posts, while adding further features that allow you to manage your events. This includes the possibility of repeating your event according to complex schedules and assign your events to venues. This can all be done through an intuitive user interface, which allows you to view your events in the familiar WordPress list or in a calendar page in the amin area.

== Installation ==

Installation is standard and straight forward. 

1. Upload `event-organiser` folder (and all it's contents!) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Check Settings > Event Organiser


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to create an event =

Events behave very similarly to standard posts. To create a event, select the 'Add New' submenu from 'Events' menu. The chief difference between events and post is the 'Event Details' metabox which sets the date and venue data related to the event.

You can also add events in the Calendar view in a manner similiar to Google Calendar. By selecting one (or multiple) days (in month mode) or times (in week/day mode) you can create an event that spans the selected period. 

= The Event Pages Don't Look Right =

Unfortunately its impossible for the default templates to work with *every* theme. Occasionally, they simply don't work well with a given theme - the event content might not appear right, or the sidebar might seem displaced. The solution is to edit the default templates to fit in with your theme (you can use your theme's own templates as a guideline). [You can find more information here](http://wp-event-organiser.com/documentation/editing-the-templates/)


= How do I display events? =

Events are automatically displayed on the events page: try `www.your-wordpress-site.com/?post_type=event` (If you have permalinks enabled these will have 'prettier' versions). Similarly there are venue and event category pages. Each of these pages have their own associated template which are present in the **template** sub-directory of the Event Organiser plug-in folder. To override the default templates, simply create the appropriately named files in your theme directory.

**Widgets**
The plug-in also provides the following widgets ([see widget documentation](http://wp-event-organiser.com/documentation/widgets/)):

* **Event list** - list events allows with options to filter by venue, categories and dates.
* **Calendar** - display a calendar, similiar to the WordPress calendar, that displays your events.
* **Agenda** - displays your events in a list grouped by date and navigated with AJAX.

**Shortcodes**
Among others, the plug-in also provides the following shortcodes ([see shortcode documentation](http://wp-event-organiser.com/documentation/shortcodes/)):

* **Event list & Widget Calendar** - shortcode versions of their widget counterparts.
* **Full calendar** - a calendar, similiar to the admin calendar, with optional month, week and day views and category and venue filters

**Template Functions**
Finally, the plug-in provides a function `eo_get_events()` which is similiar to WordPress' `get_posts()`. It returns an array of post objects (where the posts are events), and this can be used to display events through editing your theme. The usual WordPress functions for display associated information (author, title etc) are still available to you, and the plug-in provides a similar set of functions to display event related data (dates, venues etc). [See the documentation for more information](http://www.wp-event-organiser.com/documentation/function-reference/).


= The full calendar doesn't display any events =

The calendar should display all published events. If you find the calendar doesn't appear this is usually caused by the theme you are using, and is verifiable by temporarily switching to the TwentyEleven theme. If the theme is the cause this is normally because:

* The theme de-registers the jQuery / jQuery UI shipped with WordPress and registers an outdated version
* The theme does not call [`wp_footer`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_footer) in the footer

If the calendar *does* appear, but gets stuck loading, the cause is usually the AJAX response. If your site is in 'debug' mode - this can be due to error messages from other plug-ins being printed. You can view the AJAX response in your browsers console (E.g. Firefox's firebug or Chrome's dev tools). If you are still unable to determine the cause of the problem, or how to fix, please use the plug-in forums with a link to your site and I'll take a look.


= I cannot navigate between months on the widget calendar =

If clicking on the 'next' month causes the page to reload - the javascript has not been loaded. This is usually because the theme does not call [`wp_footer`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_footer) in the footer. 

If the calendar simply does not respond this is usually because your theme does not allow widgets to add their own ID and classes. Somewhere in the theme folder your theme will make use of `register_sidebar()` (probably in `functions.php`. It should look something like:

    register_sidebar(array(
      'name' => __( 'Side bar name' ),
      'id' => 'sidebar-id',
      'description' => __( 'Widget area description' ),
      'before_title' => '<h1>',
      'after_title' => '</h1>',
      'before_widget' => '<div id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">',
      'after_widget' => '</div>',
    ));
    
Notice the `%1$s` and `%2$s` in the `before_widget` argument. These allow the widget to add their own ID and classes to the widget. If your theme does not use `class="widget %2$s"` (they should!) the month navigation for the widget calendar will not work. 

If you are still unable to determine the cause of the problem, or how to fix, please use the plug-in forums with a link to your site and I'll take a look.


= What ShortCodes are available? = 

Event Organiser provides the following shortcodes:

* `[eo_events]`  - displays a list of events allows with options to filter by venue, categories and dates.
* `[eo_calendar]`  - displays a widget-calendar of your events, similiar to WordPress' calendar, and navigated with AJAX.
* `[eo_fullcalendar]`  - displays a calendar, similiar to the admin calendar, with optional month, week and day views and category and venue filters.
* `[eo_venue_map]` - displays a Google map of the current venue, or of a particular venue given as an attribute.
* `[eo_subscribe]` - wraps the content in a link which allows visitors to subscribe to your events; there are two types: 'Google' and 'Webcal'.

More information on shortcodes is [available here](http://wp-event-organiser.com/documentation/shortcodes/)
